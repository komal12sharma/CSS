    <b>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the
        physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.
        <br> These are some things which reminds me of nature :)

        <h1>mountains-a peaceful place </h1>
    </u>
    <div id="container">Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of
        up to tens of millions of years. Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action
        of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and
        glaciers.
        A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed
        bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically
        rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but
        most occur in mountain ranges.
        High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. These colder
        climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals.
        Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for
        resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing.
        The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft)
        above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at
        21,171 m (69,459 ft).</div>

            <h1>What is a Mountain?</h1>
        </u>
        <p>
            Though a mountain is typically taller than a hill, there is no official height designation. An abrupt
            difference in local topography is often described as a mountain, and such features will often have "mount"
            or "mountain" in their name; examples include Mount Hood, Mount Ranier, and Mount Washington.

            Some accepted characteristics of a mountain are:

            A natural mound of earth created by faulting
            A very steep rise in the landscape that is often abrupt in comparison to its surroundings
            A minimum height of just over 2,000 feet2ï»¿
            A steep slope and a defined summit or peak
            Often has a name
            Depending on the slopes and elevation, mountains can be a challenge to climb
            Of course, there are exceptions to these assumptions and some features that would otherwise be called
            "mountains" have the word "hills" in their name.</p>

        <h4>The Importance of Mountains

            Mountains are particularly important for their biodiversity, water, clean air, research, cultural diversity,
            leisure, landscape and spiritual values.</h4>
